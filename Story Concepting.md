Elysium sees her getting thrown out and brings her to her house and gives her some clothes.


### Dialogue

<sup>
We should add text effect in the final game, like shaking, colors, etc.
Also the names in `()` wont be in the game, it's just here to make it less confusing, in the game we use colors to differentiate between characters.

**Inner monologue**: You walk beside her, your body stiff and awkward.
**Inner monologue**: As you walk, you try to to clear your mind, hoping that maybe some memories will come back to you.


## Fiore encounter

Elyseum takes Nyarly to the local inn one evening to drink something and tell her the state of the world (not lore dumping chat). Before she can do that they it gets rowdy in the inn (gotta get some comedic timing in, "You have really appears at bad time.. *commotion starts*" or something)  where fiore is getting harassed for what they are wearing, Elysium puts a stop to this, something something they join forces.


## Ijsbrand encounter
